## Installing a compiler

Computers can only understand a single language, and that is machine code. Therefore, any program that is written in human-readable code has to be converted into machine code in order to be executed. In C++, this process is known as _compilation_, and is performed by a program known as a _compiler_. Therefore, in order to run C++ code on your computer, you first need to install a C++ compiler.

There are many different compilers to use, depending on what operating system you are running on, but this tutorial will simply use the recommended compiler for each operating system.
