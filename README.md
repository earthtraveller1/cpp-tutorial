# C++ Tutorial

Hello, and welcome to this C++ tutorial! I assume that you are here because you wanted to learn C++. C++ is a general-purposed, compiled language that performs very well and is often used in cases in which performance is very important, such us in video games, web renderers, and operating systems. Another advantage of C++ is that it can directly interface with low-level C APIs such as OpenGL, Vulkan, and Win32, making it suitable for programs that needs as much control of it's execution environment as possible. C++ is also a very versatile programming language, making it suitable for large-scale software projects. And, of course, some people use C++ just because they like it (FYI I'm not one of them).

## Assumptions

C++ is never designed to be a beginner language, and this tutorial won't try to pretend that it is one. Therefore, if you are someone who has little to no programming experience, I would highly suggest using a different language like Python to get started instead, as the learning curve in Python is much smoother. As a result, this tutorial assumes that you have experience with another programming language before, though it won't assume which language specifically. Therefore, you understand core programming concepts such as functions, variables, arrays (known as _lists_ in some languages), etc.
