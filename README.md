# C++ Tutorial

Hello, and welcome to C++! This tutorial is written under the assumption that, you, the reader, is interested in learning C++ and wants to learn how to master the C++ programming language. C++ is a versatile and extremely powerful programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979. Due to it's power, it's rarely used properly by programmers and is often the target of many criticisms of systems programming in general.

This tutorial aims to teach the reader how to use Modern C++. Essentially, C++20, which is the latest revision of the C++ standard. C++ is technically backwards compatible, so code written to target older versions of C++ (like C++11, C++17, or C++98) are also valid C++20 code. However, many conventions around C++ programming has changed significantly, and C++20 code often looks very different from code targeting an older version of C++.

Also, one thing that has to be made clear is the assumptions that this tutorial makes about you, the reader. First of all, C++ is not a beginner's language, and this tutorial will not pretend that it is. Therefore, if you have little to no previous experience in programming, I would highly suggest you start with a different language rather than C++ and/or use a different tutorial. Part of this is that this tutorial assumes that the reader has some level of experience in programming with a different language, though we won't assume which one.

To get started, head to the [getting started](Tutorial/01_GettingStarted.md) page and I'll see you from there!
