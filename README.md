# C++ Tutorial

Hello, and welcome to C++! This tutorial is written under the assumption that, you, the reader, is interested in learning C++ and wants to learn how to master the C++ programming language. C++ is a versatile and extremely powerful programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979. Due to it's power, it's rarely used properly by programmers and is often the target of many criticisms of systems programming in general.

This tutorial aims to teach the reader how to use Modern C++. Essentially, C++20, which is the latest revision of the C++ standard. C++ is technically backwards compatible, so code written to target older versions of C++ (like C++11, C++17, or C++98) are also valid C++20 code. However, many conventions around C++ programming has changed significantly, and C++20 code often looks very different from code targeting an older version of C++.
